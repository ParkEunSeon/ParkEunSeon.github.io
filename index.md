## smooth communication

원활한 수업진행을 위한 프로그램 설치 및 설정

### 1. Chrome setting and remote desktop

크롬을 기본 브라우저로 설정하고 **크롬 원격 데스크톱**을 설치한다. 위 과정은 원활한 수업진행을 위해 공통된 브라우저를 사용하고 해결하기 어려운 경우 원격 데스크톱을 이용해 빠른 해결을 하기 위함이다.

### 2. Slack download and participation

Slack을 이용해 파일을 공유할 수 있고, 전하고자하는 내용을 채팅으로 대화하기 위함이다.

## Creating a blog using github

수업을 통해 배운 내용을 블로그에 작성함으로써 하루에 배운 내용 및 중요한 내용을 정리한다:

### 1. git Download

형상관리(버전관리)를 하기 위해서 git을 활용해서 버전관리를 한다.

### 2. Visual studio code Download

개발Tool로서 Visual studio code를 다운로드 한다.
웹기반의 에디터 프로그램으로 가볍고 강력(확장프로그램 다수 보유)하여 해당 개발Tool을 사용한다.

## Version management

cmd창을 이용해 로컬의 파일을 서버에 올리는 작업을 한다.

### 1. 기본 cmd 명령어 사용하기

#### 1. 작업소스를 관리하는 폴더 만들기

작업소스를 관리하기 위한 폴더를 생성한다.
폴더위치 및 폴더명은 다음과 같다. **C:\apps\git_test**
위의 폴더에 apps 폴더 및 git_test 폴더를 생성하려면 cmd에서 실행해야하는 명령어는 아래와 같다.
```javascript
  cd /
  mkdir apps
  cd apps
  mkdir git_test && cd git_test
```

해당 폴더를 git 버전관리를 위한 폴더로 지정하려면 **git init** 을 cmd창에 실행하면 된다.

#### 2. git hub 회원가입 및 로컬과 연결하기

github 홈페이지로 들어가서 회원가입을 한다.
회원가입을 한 후 new repository를 클릭해 repository의 이름을 설정한다.
repository명과 로컬의 작업폴더명을 동일하게 설정해두었다.
repository를 생성했다면 cmd 창에서 아래의 명령어를 실행한다.

```javascript
git remote add origin https://github.com/UserName/workplaceName.git
git branch -M main
git push -u origin main
```

위의 두줄은 딱 한번만 실행하는 코드지만 맨 아래의 명령어는 로컬에서 수정이 생겨서 
서버에 반영하고자 하는 경우에 계속 실행하는 명령어로서 자연스럽게 외우게 될 것이다.

#### 3. 로컬에서 수정한 소스를 서버에 반영하는 방법

우리는 소스를 Visual studio code를 통해 생성 및 수정할 것이다.
생성 및 수정한 파일을 서버에 올리고자 한다면 다음과 같은 명령어를 cmd창에서 실행시켜주면 된다.

```javascript
git add .
git commit -m "수정한 내용"
git push -u origin main
```

**git add .**은 생성/수정/삭제된 소스에 한해서만 status에 올리겠다는 뜻이다.
**git commit -m "수정한 내용"** 은 commit하겠다는 뜻이다.
**git push -u origin main**은 main branch에 넣겠다는 뜻이다.(서버반영)

위의 내용을 통하여 우리는 버전관리를 하게 된다.
위 내용은 github 홈페이지에서 확인할 수 있다.

<!-- The `sidebar: mydoc_sidebar` refers to the \_data/sidebars/mydoc_sidebar.yml file.

Note that your sidebar can only have 2 levels (expand the **Tag archives** option to see an example of the second level). Given that each product has its own sidebar, this depth should be sufficient (it's really like 3 levels). Deeper nesting goes against usability recommendations.

You can optionally turn off the sidebar on any page (e.g. landing pages). To turn off the sidebar for a page, you should set the page frontmatter tag as `hide_sidebar: true`.

If you don't declare a sidebar, the `home_sidebar` file gets used as the default because this is the default specified in the config file: -->
<!-- 
```yaml
-
  scope:
    path: ""
    type: "pages"
  values:
    layout: "page"
    comments: true
    search: true
    sidebar: home_sidebar
    topnav: topnav
```

If you want to set different sidebar defaults based on different folders for your pages, specify your defaults like this:

```
-
  scope:
    path: "pages/mydoc"
    type: "pages"
  values:
    layout: "page"
    comments: true
    search: true
    sidebar: mydoc_sidebar
    topnav: topnav
```

This would load the `mydoc_sidebar` for each file in **pages/mydoc**. You could set different defaults for different path scopes.

For more detail on the sidebar, see [Sidebar navigation][mydoc_sidebar_navigation].

## Top navigation

The top navigation works just like the sidebar. You can specify which topnav data file should load by adding a `topnav` property in your page, like this:

```yaml
topnav: topnav
```

Here the topnav refers to the `_data/topnav.yml` file.

Because most topnav options will be the same, the `_config.yml` file specifies the topnav file as a default:

```yaml
-
  scope:
    path: ""
    type: "pages"
  values:
    layout: "page"
    comments: true
    search: true
    sidebar: home_sidebar
    topnav: topnav
```

## Sidebar syntax

The sidebar data file uses a specific YAML syntax that you must follow. Follow the sample pattern shown in the theme, specically looking at `mydoc_sidebar.yml` as an example: Here's a code sample showing all levels:

```yaml
entries:
- title: sidebar
  product: Study Lecord
  version: 0.1
  folders:
  - title: Overview
    output: web, pdf
    folderitems:

    - title: Get started
      url: /index.html
      output: web, pdf
      type: homepage

    - title: Introduction
      url: /mydoc_introduction.html
      output: web, pdf

  - title: Release Notes
    output: web, pdf
    folderitems:

    - title: 6.0 Release notes
      url: /mydoc_release_notes_60.html
      output: web, pdf

    - title: 5.0 Release notes
      url: /mydoc_release_notes_50.html
      output: web, pdf

  - title: Tag archives
    output: web
    folderitems:

    - title: Tag archives overview
      url: /mydoc_tag_archives_overview.html
      output: web

      subfolders:
      - title: Tag archive pages
        output: web
        subfolderitems:

        - title: Formatting pages
          url: /tag_formatting.html
          output: web

        - title: Navigation pages
          url: /tag_navigation.html
          output: web

        - title: Content types pages
          url: /tag_content_types.html
          output: web
```

Each `folder` or `subfolder` must contain a `title` and `output` property. Each `folderitem` or `subfolderitem` must contain a `title`, `url`, and `output` property.

The two outputs available are `web` and `pdf`. (Even if you aren't publishing PDF, you still need to specify `output: web`).

The YAML syntax depends on exact spacing, so make sure you follow the pattern shown in the sample sidebars. See my [YAML tutorial](mydoc_yaml_tutorial) for more details about how YAML works.

{% include note.html content="If you have just one character of spacing off, Jekyll won't build due to the YAML syntax error. You'll see an error message in your console that says \"Error ... did not find expected key while parsing a block mapping at line 22 column 5. Error: Run jekyll build --trace for more information.\" If you encounter this, it usually refers to incorrect indentation or spacing in the YAML file. See the example mydoc_sidebar.yml file to see where your formatting went wrong." %}

Each level must have at least one topic before the next level starts. You can't have a second level that contains multiple third levels without having at least one standalone topic in the second level. If you need a hierarchy that has a folder that contains other folders and no loose topics, use a blank `-` item like this:

```yaml
entries:
- title: sidebar
  product: Sunny's Study Lecord Blog
  version: 0.1
  folders:
  - title: Overview
    output: web, pdf
    folderitems:

    -

  - title: Release Notes
    output: web, pdf
    folderitems:

    - title: 6.0 Release notes
      url: /mydoc_release_notes_60.html
      output: web, pdf

    - title: 5.0 Release notes
      url: /mydoc_release_notes_50.html
      output: web, pdf

  - title: Installation
    output: web, pdf
    folderitems:

    - title: About Ruby, Gems, Bundler, etc.
      url: /mydoc_about_ruby_gems_etc.html
      output: web, pdf

    - title: Install Jekyll on Mac
      url: /mydoc_install_jekyll_on_mac.html
      output: web, pdf

    - title: Install Jekyll on Windows
      url: /mydoc_install_jekyll_on_windows.html
      output: web, pdf
```

To accommodate the title page and table of contents in PDF outputs, each product sidebar must list these pages before any other:

```yaml
- title:
  output: pdf
  type: frontmatter
  folderitems:
  - title:
    url: /titlepage
    output: pdf
    type: frontmatter
  - title:
    url: /tocpage
    output: pdf
    type: frontmatter
```

Leave the output as `output: pdf` for these frontmatter pages so that they don't appear in the web output.

For more detail on the sidebar, see [Sidebar navigation][mydoc_sidebar_navigation] and [YAML tutorial][mydoc_yaml_tutorial].

## Comments

The theme integrates [Commento.io](https://commento.io/) for comments below pages and posts. (This commenting service doesn't inject controversial tracking ads like Disqus does.) You will need to Commento.io account + plan ($5/month) to authorize Commento with your domain (no other configuration should be required). If you don't want comments, in the \_config.yml file, change the `comments: true` properties (under `defaults`) to `comments: false` in every instance. Then in the commento.html include file (inside \_includes), the `{% raw %}{% unless page.comments == false %} ... {% endunless %}{% endraw %}` logic will not insert the Commentio form.

## Relative links and offline viewing

This theme uses relative links throughout so that you can view the site offline and not worry about which server or directory you're hosting it. It's common with tech docs to push content to an internal server for review prior to pushing the content to an external server for publication. Because of the need for seamless transferrence from one host to another, the site has to use relative links.

To view pages locally on your machine (without the Jekyll preview server), they need to have the `.html` extension. The `permalink` property in the page's frontmatter (without surrounding slashes) is what pushes the files into the root directory when the site builds.

## Page frontmatter

When you write pages, include these same frontmatter properties with each page:

```yaml
---
title: "Some title"
tags: [sample1, sample2]
keywords: keyword1, keyword2, keyword3
last_updated: Month day, year
summary: "optional summary here"
sidebar: sidebarname
permalink: filename.html
---
```

(You will customize the values for each of these properties, of course.)

For titles, surrounding the title in quotes is optional, but if you have a colon in the title, you must surround the title with quotation marks. If you have a quotation mark inside the title, escape it first with a backlash `\`.

Values for `keywords` get populated into the metadata of the page for SEO.

Values for `tags` must be defined in your \_data/tags.yml list. You also need a corresponding tag file inside the tags folder pages/tags/ that follows the same pattern as the other tag files shown in the tags folder. (Jekyll won't auto-create these tag files.)

If you don't want the mini-TOC to show on a page (such as for the homepage or landing pages), add `toc: false` in the frontmatter.

The `permalink` value should be the same as your filename and include the ".html" file extension.

For more detail, see [Pages][mydoc_pages].

## Where to store your documentation topics

You can store your files for each product inside subfolders following the pattern shown in the theme. For example, product1, product2, etc, can be stored in their own subfolders inside the \_pages directory. Inside \_pages, you can store your topics inside sub-subfolders or sub-sub-folders to your heart's content. When Jekyll builds your site, it will pull the topics into the root directory and use the permalink for the URL.

Note that product1, product2, and mydoc are all just sample content to demonstrate how to add multiple products into the theme. You can freely delete that content.

For more information, see [Pages][mydoc_pages] and [Posts][mydoc_posts].

## Configure the top navigation

The top navigation bar's menu items are set through the \_data/topnav.yml file. Use the top navigation bar to provide links for navigating from one product to another, or to navigate to external resources.

For external URLs, use `external_url` in the item property, as shown in the example topnav.yml file. For internal links, use `url` the same was you do in the sidebar data files.

Note that the topnav has two sections: `topnav` and `topnav_dropdowns`. The topnav section contains single links, while the `topnav_dropdowns` section contains dropdown menus. The two sections are independent of each other.

## Generating PDF

If you want to generate PDF, you'll need a license for [Prince XML](http://www.princexml.com/). You will also need to [install Prince](http://www.princexml.com/doc/installing/).  You can generate PDFs by product (but not for every product on the site combined together into one massive PDF). Prince will work even without a license, but it will imprint a small Prince image on the first page, and you're supposed to buy the license to use it.

If you're on Windows, install [Git Bash client](https://git-for-windows.github.io/) rather than using the default Windows command prompt.

Open up the css/printstyles.css file and customize the email address (`youremail@domain.com`) that is listed there. This email address appears in the bottom left footer of the PDF output. You'll also need to create a PDF configuration file following the examples shown in the pdfconfigs folder, and also customize some build scripts following the same pattern shown in the root: pdf-product1.sh

See the section on [Generating PDFs][mydoc_generating_pdfs] for more details about setting the theme up for this output.

## Blogs / News

For blog posts, create your markdown files in the \_posts folder following the sample formats. Post file names always begin with the date (YYYY-MM-DD-title).

The news/news.html file displays the posts, and the news_archive.html file shows a yearly history of posts. In documentation, you might use the news to highlight product features outside of your documentation, or to provide release notes and other updates.

See [Posts][mydoc_posts] for more information.

## Markdown

This theme uses [kramdown markdown](http://kramdown.gettalong.org/). kramdown is similar to Github-flavored Markdown, except that when you have text that intercepts list items, the spacing of the intercepting text must align with the spacing of the first character after the space of a numbered list item. Basically, with your list item numbering, use two spaces after the dot in the number, like this:

```
1.  First item
2.  Second item
3.  Third item
```

When you want to insert paragraphs, notes, code snippets, or other matter in between the list items, use four spaces to indent. The four spaces will line up with the first letter of the list item (the <b>F</b>irst or <b>S</b>econd or <b>T</b>hird).

```
1.  First item

    ```
    alert("hello");
    ```

2.  Second item

    Some pig!

3.  Third item
```

See the topics under "Formatting" in the sidebar for more information.

## Automated links

If you want to use an automated system for managing links, see [Automated Links][mydoc_hyperlinks.html#automatedlinks]. This approach automatically creates a list of Markdown references to simplify linking.
